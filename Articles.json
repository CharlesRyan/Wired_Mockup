        "content": "Finally fed up with being held back by societal constraints, Elon Musk has revealed to the world that he has decided to forgo any further misdirection and declare to the world his status as a supervillain. 'It's just so hard to get any meaningful work done weighed down by the constructs of lesser minds like ethics and fair labor laws.' says Musk 'Plus you'd be surprised how few people are willing to live the rest of their lives on Mars, despite the benefit it would represent to our species. That's why I've decided to eliminate choice from the matter and set up a sort of draft.' Musk is determined not to be held back by shortfalls in voluntary recruitment programs, which have so far failed to meet his expectations. In a hundred years, humanity will likely look upon this series of decicions with favor, but try telling that to the unwilling future Martians."

        "content": "We were somewhere around Morgan Hill when the drugs began to take hold. I remember saying something like 'I feel a bit lightheaded; maybe you should drive....' And suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and screeching and diving around the car, which was going about a hundred miles an hour with the top down to Palo Alto. And a voice was screaming: 'Holy Jesus! What are these goddamn animals?' Then it was quiet again. My attorney had taken his shirt off and was pouring beer on his chest, to facilitate the tanning process. 'What are you on about?' he muttered, staring up at the sun with his eyes closed and covered with wraparound Spanish sunglasses. 'Never mind,' I said. 'It's your turn to drive.' I hit the brakes and aimed the Great Red Shark toward the shoulder of the highway. No point mentioning those bats, I thought. The poor bastard will see them soon enough."

        "content": "Danish filmmaker Jorgen Leth, the scene appears in his art movie '66 scenes from america' which was filmed in 1981. Jorgen Leth did not know Warhol, but he was a bit obsessed with him so he definitely wanted to have him in his movie. Friends told Leth that he 'should forget about it' and that he could never even approach Warhol. Leth was stubborn so when he came to New York for his movie he simply went to the 'factory', the building Warhol had rented to work at and despite all other claims simply managed to get to Warhol's studio inside where he met Andy Warhol while he was currently working. Leth just told Warhol about his movie and the idea of having Andy being one of the 66 scenes along with the highly 'symbolic' burger. Warhol immediately liked the idea and agreed to the scene. Andy liked the scene as he said because it was such a real scene, something he would like to do. So Andy Warhol agreed to come for filming a few days later. Jorgen leth was a bit afraid that Warhol would not come. He had invited him to a photo studio in new York at 14th street/5th avenue that belonged to a friend of him. Leth had his assistant buy some burgers and directly advised him to buy some in halfway neutral packaging as Leth was afraid that Warhol might reject some brands (Warhol always had an obsession with some of his favorite brands). So Andy Warhol finally did arrive at the studio, of course along with his bodyguards, and when he saw the selection of burgers the assistant had brought he asked 'Where is the McDonald's?' and Leth - slightly in panic - was immediately like 'I thought you would maybe not like to identify... ' and Warhol answered 'no that is the most beautiful'. Leth offered to let his assistant quickly run to McDonald's but Warhol refused like 'No, never mind, I will take the Burger King.' Directing the video was pretty simple. Leth said to him: 'You simply have to eat this hamburger. And then after you finished, you have to eat it, after you finish you should just tell the camera, to the camera, my name is Andy Warhol, I have just eaten a hamburger.' Leth was worried during the taking as he forgot to give Warhol a glass of water and the bottle of ketchup was brand new, so it was hard to get it out. But being a real warhol there was only one take, one try, so Warhol pulled it through in just one take, roughly 5 minutes. But Leth liked the scene and how it came out."

The recent rise in wearable technology like the Apple Watch and Samsung Gear has been so appalling to him that he could no longer stay silent. 'It seems like everybody is clamoring to have a life akin to the worst years of mine' He tells me as we sit at his kitchen table. His dismembered arm is laying on the table to be repaired as we talk. 'The constant connectivity, charging, and repairing are enough to drive anybody mad. The idea that anybody would pay for this life is unfathomable to me.' He bemoans while hunched over one of the coolest pieces of machinery I've ever seen the inside of. I can't go into detail about the gadgets and exact functions of this portion of him due to an agreement of discretion necessary for this interview to happen, but I can say there was more functions focused on deadly use of force than I had expected. For all he had to say, I would have traded places with him immediately for any price. He just seemed like a mopey guy with a limited imagination."

        "content": "Jeffrey C. Ponzi, the 32 year-old grand-nephew of the infamous scam artist Charles Ponzi, has chosen a bewildering line of work considering his family name and history. Ponzi Investments, LLC has garnered almost no client base in its six months of operation. Apparently their motto 'We are totally legitimate' does little to relieve potential clients of the doubt caused by the company's name. Charles Ponzi is infamous for running an investing firm that didn't do any actual investing. When clients would request a withdrawl from their 'investment' accounts, Ponzi would pay them with money given to the firm by other clients. Very little of the money made it to the stock market. Most would end up in Ponzi's private account. The sucess of the scheme depended on a constant flow of new money to pay out the previous investors. Bernie Madoff ran the most recent example of such a scheme, which was unearthed in 2008 during the Great Recession when investors were divesting rather than investing. The new money flow dried up and Madoff had spent too much money to pay back his client's principal with the promised interest. When asked why anyone would think an investing firm could appear reputable with the Ponzi name on it, Jeff replied: 'It appears reputable because it has to be with a name like that. It's like saying 'I'm a liar and a thief, but not a liar about being a thief.'' It seems salesmanship does not run in the family."

Similarly, if you never leave your house, the chances of you crossing paths with a criminal are greatly diminished. The safest thing to do in all cases is lay on the floor in the fetal position and wait for a responsible person to come along and help. Also don't read books. There are dangerous ideas in those that the world is a safe place and worth exploring. It's not. Order groceries by delivery and sit on the floor with your eyes closed in order to avoid any and all excitement/danger. Don't get a pet either. Cats are disloyal and fickle. Dogs are wonderful but so friendly that they may give you the dangerous notion that you should leave the house and be friendly as well. Make no friends and do no things. Ever."
